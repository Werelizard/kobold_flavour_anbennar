 #Greenscales
 KAS_GSC_ideas:0 "Greenscale Ideas"
 KAS_GSC_ideas_bonus:0 "Greenscale Ambition"
 KAS_GSC_ideas_start:0 "Greenscale Traditions"
 kas_gsc_colonial_spree:0 "The Sea Calls"
 kas_gsc_colonial_spree_desc:0 "Great and green, beautiful and blud, shining under the bright stars: it calls to us. The smell of salt tickles are nosetrils, as we curiously ponder where these strange currents may take us."
 kas_gsc_coastal_burrows:0 "Coastal Burrows"
 kas_gsc_coastal_burrows_desc:0 "The coast has become our home. Yet, it has not become a proper one. Consolidating our dens and digging within the rocky faces we shall make this a safe enclave for our kind."
 kas_gsc_trade_expansion:0 "Kobold Markets Practice"
 kas_gsc_trade_expansion_desc:0 "People have always perceived us as pests, nuisances. But we have proven our worth. We shall show all the tall-folk - from the ones which delve in the trees to those who find shelter in great towers - that we have things to offer, shiny trinkets to share."
 kas_gsc_storm_manoeuvre:0 "Storm-Ships"
 kas_gsc_storm_manoeuvre_desc:0 "The sea of storms calls down a frequent barrage of winds and tempests. To many this would be perceived as either a danger or a challenge, but to us this is an idea, the log for a fire which will fuel our inspiration: great, thunder-spewing ships, with kobolds at their helms."
 kas_gsc_kobold_sea:0 "Kobold Sea"
 kas_gsc_kobold_sea_desc:0 "The sea is ours and will always be ours. Let it be known to Gnomes, Men and Elves and all who would crush us: these waters are ours, and we will defend our new watery den with teeth and fang and sail and canon."
 kas_gsc_northern_scales:0 "The Northern Scales"
 kas_gsc_northern_scales_desc:0 "Our relative isolation and turn to trade allowed us some leniency from the cruel tall-folk. Where others of our kind might face scorn, we face tolerance - tolerance that can be leveraged. Tolerance that can be put to good use."
 kas_gsc_kobold_push_inwards:0 "Push Inwards"
 kas_gsc_kobold_push_inwards_desc:0 "While we've tamed the wails of the ocean, there are whispers in the air - whiffs of gold in the hills. A dazzle in the rivers. A shine in the streams. There is much to be done inland as well, and afterall, are we not of the hills and mountains just as much as we are now of the coast?"

 #Redscales
 KAS_RSC_ideas:0 "Redscales Ideas"
 KAS_RSC_ideas_bonus:0 "Redscales Ambition"
 KAS_RSC_ideas_start:0 "Redscales Traditions"
 KAS_RSC_flank_ambush:0 "Flanking Tactics"
 KAS_RSC_flank_ambush_desc:0 "Throughout the Kobolds' push throughout the Dragon Coast, the Redscales showed themselves particularly adept in warfare, inparticular in the art of ambushing and feigning the Gnomes' pitiful troops - only to turn around and destroy them at the last second."
 KAS_RSC_tribute_collectors:0 "Tribute Collectors"
 KAS_RSC_tribute_collectors_desc:0 "Gold, trinkets, shinies and jewels: all will be ours!"
 KAS_RSC_gnome_slayers:0 "Gnome Slayers"
 KAS_RSC_gnome_slayers_desc:0 "The war with the Gnomes may come to a close, and when it will we will be the undisputed conquerors of the coast. Our ambition will be known to all - and the Gnomes will make a fine example."
 KAS_RSC_blood_red_scales:0 "Blood Red Scales"
 KAS_RSC_blood_red_scales_desc:0 "Diplomacy - the softer kind - is best left to anyone but the Redscales. Threats, one-sided negotiations and other sorts of underhanded tactics are all valid strategies, especially when fighting against the so called 'civilised people'."
 KAS_RSC_hill_towns:0 "Hill Towns"
 KAS_RSC_hill_towns_desc:0 "The Redscales' dominion comprises many settlements and many more dens. The recent explosion in population and the renewed verve to fight have contributed to a recruitment upsurge, allowing us to call forth many more soldiers for a smaller expense."
 KAS_RSC_firebombs:0 "Bomb'em Out"
 KAS_RSC_firebombs_desc:0 "Kobolds are not, as the Gnomes would lie, unintelligent creatures. Our minds are sharp, and even if at times unfocused, equally gifted in the arts of artificery. They may have underestimated us then, but as we rain fire upon their homes that is likely to change."
 KAS_RSC_the_yipping_scourge:0 "The Yipping Scourge"
 KAS_RSC_the_yipping_scourge_desc:0 "Words sting, but double so when yelled at against an opponent twice your size."

 #Bluecales
 KAS_BSC_ideas:0 "Bluescales Ideas"
 KAS_BSC_ideas_bonus:0 "Bluescales Ambition"
 KAS_BSC_ideas_start:0 "Bluescales Traditions"
 KAS_BSC_dig_and_hide:0 "Dig and Hide"
 KAS_BSC_dig_and_hide_desc:0 "Kobolds are a crafty lot, and we particularly are adept at digging out rocky faces and tunnels - turning hills and mountains into deadly traps. Waging asymmetrical warfare is what we do best after all."
 KAS_BSC_treasure_guardians:0 "Treasure Guardians"
 KAS_BSC_treasure_guardians_desc:0 "The Bluescale clan holds the greatest treasure of all Kobold-Kind: the Kobold Hoard. This has brought us great prestige, as well as a leverage over the other Kobold clans in the Dragon Coast."
 KAS_BSC_integrate_clans:0 "Integrate the Clans"
 KAS_BSC_integrate_clans_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Kobold Rising left us divided, spread thin. Let us bring those astray under our fold, and in time, any other people which we have come to rule."
 KAS_BSC_communality:0 "Kobold Communal Spirit"
 KAS_BSC_communality_desc:0 "Kobolds may appear a feisty, disunified lot - and there are of course many truths to that. However, we are also one people, brought together by faith, conflict, opression and crafty nature."
 KAS_BSC_kobold_unification:0 "The Dragon Coast Unification"
 KAS_BSC_kobold_unification_desc:0 "The expansion of the Bluescale domain has brought the need for reforms to our way to see things. As we grow out further, this has led to a whole re-thinking of our administration, both as a means to make our government more efficient as well as bringing the faraway clans under our heel."
 KAS_BSC_gleaming_caves:0 "The Gleaming Caves"
 KAS_BSC_gleaming_caves_desc:0 "The Dragon Coast's caves are beautiful to all, a natural wonder in its own. Encouraging our artisans and crafters to exploit the innumerable gems dotting our dens' walls will not only lead to additional crowns flowing into our coffers but is also bound to make merchants curious and perhaps willing to make trade with us."
 KAS_BSC_resist_storm:0 "Whether the Storm"
 KAS_BSC_resist_storm_desc:0 "We've fought through the Gnomes' scourge and the wars with our kin. And we prevailed. At the end of it all we stand tall, having whethered the raging tempest of war, betrayal and hardships. The Bluescales remain unbroken and untamed."

 #Darkscales
 KAS_DSC_ideas:0 "Darkscales Ideas"
 KAS_DSC_ideas_bonus:0 "Darkscales Ambition"
 KAS_DSC_ideas_start:0 "Darkscales Traditions"
 KAS_DSC_settlers_dwarovar:0 "Dwarovar Claimants"
 KAS_DSC_settlers_dwarovar_desc:0 "The Dwarovar is home to many races, many tongues, many tunnels and many folk: from the Dwarves to the Goblins, to the Orcs and even the Ogres, the mountains are a battlefield. We find ourselves here - struggling to survive. And we shall make this labyrinth ours."
 KAS_DSC_mushroom_collectors:0 "Mushroom Collectors"
 KAS_DSC_mushroom_collectors_desc:0 "The fungi growing in the damp shadow of the Serpentspine have proven to be rather nutritious - perhaps enough to support our expanding population. It may even be possible for us to replace our entire food supply with these tasty mushrooms, or maybe not."
 KAS_DSC_steal_from_dwarves:0 "Steal From the Dwarves"
 KAS_DSC_steal_from_dwarves_desc:0 "The Dwarves are not like the other tall-folk in appearance, but they are just as clever. Some may say their minds are among the brightest. Our recent advances have exposed some of our people to these practices, and those of our kind that have sat in awe before their wonders believe we should 'borrow' some of their finest manuals and texts which they have conviniently left behind."
 KAS_DSC_tunnel_prospector_companies:0 "Tunnel Prospection Companies"
 KAS_DSC_tunnel_prospector_companies_desc:0 "The establishment of prospection companies will help us map the maze of passages and ravines we've grown to call home. This will allow us to take our enemies by surprise, but also dispatch courriers much faster."
 KAS_DSC_small_but_unbroken:0 "Small but Unbroken"
 KAS_DSC_small_but_unbroken_desc:0 "We were lost, but we have found ourselves and our place in the world, and it is under this mountain we have claimed as ours. We will not leave. We will fight."
 KAS_DSC_hope_for_kobold_kind:0 "Hope for Kobold-Kind"
 KAS_DSC_hope_for_kobold_kind_desc:0 "Even in these depths there is hope, even in the abyss we can find shelter, clinging outo our desire to hold onto our claims and our land. It will take a tide of Goblins or a swarm of Orcs to make a dent in our spirit."
 KAS_BSC_light_in_the_Dark:0 "A Light in the Dark"
 KAS_BSC_light_in_the_Dark_desc:0 "Our new hovel shines bright - a beacon in the under-kingdoms, a home made for Kobolds and, perhaps, others as well. We have prospered where others would have failed and perished and in doing so made our people proud: a true light in the dark."

 #Kobildzan
 KAS_KBZ_ideas:0 "Kobildzan Ideas"
 KAS_KBZ_ideas_bonus:0 "Kobildzan Ambitions"
 KAS_KBZ_ideas_start:0 "Kobildzan Traditions"
 KAS_KBZ_Kobold_Clans:0 "The Kobold Clans"
 KAS_KBZ_Kobold_Clans_desc:0 "The unification of all Dragon Coast Kobolds has allowed us an ample supply of willing soldiers and recruit for our armies, something that was and will always be utterly invaluable to our survival."
 KAS_KBZ_Claim_Coast:0 "Claim the Coast"
 KAS_KBZ_Claim_Coast_desc:0 "The Dragon Coast is ripe for conquest: Gawed and Lorent are at each others' throat, and the Empire has little to no interest in our doings. If we strike now, we can capitalise on the power vaccuum in the region."
 KAS_KBZ_Stand_Tall:0 "Stand Tall"
 KAS_KBZ_Stand_Tall_desc:0 "Men, Gnomes and even Elves: all have tried to stop us, and all have failed. The Kobolds of the Dragon Coast stand tall, unyielding and uncompromising."
 KAS_KBZ_A_Kobold_In_Every_Inn_And_Stall:0 "A Kobold in Every Inn and Market Stall"
 KAS_KBZ_A_Kobold_In_Every_Inn_And_Stall_desc:0 "As we slowly adopt a new identity, so does the rest of world begin to see us as somewhat equals. With this change in perception comes many advantages, and our people have begun establishing themselves in small communities in neighbouring countries - bolstering the reach of our mercantile ambitions."
 KAS_KBZ_Crafty_Kobolds:0 "Crafty Kobolds"
 KAS_KBZ_Crafty_Kobolds_desc:0 "We have always rivaled the Gnomes in terms of craftiness and inventive ability: be it traps, locks, weapons or artificery, Kobolds of all sizes and ages have never stopped coming up with new ideas. And while the more rigorous aspect of the sciences escape us still, we are rather incredibly gifted at making something out of anything."
 KAS_KBZ_Nation_Reborn:0 "A Nation Reborn"
 KAS_KBZ_Nation_Reborn_desc:0 "The Dragonwake is a distant memory, and we are its heirs, its legacy - the reignited embers of a Dragonic past."
 KAS_KBZ_birthplace_dragonsteel:0 "The Birthplace of Dragonsteel"
 KAS_KBZ_birthplace_dragonsteel_desc:0 "The combination of high-temperatures, high-grade iron, and quick quenching have revolutionised our metalworkling techniques. To foreigners, it is known as Koboldsteel. But to us, we refer to it by its true name: Dragonsteel."
